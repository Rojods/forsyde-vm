# Deprecated

In the interest of my research team on 2021-08-24, [I've moved the repo](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-vm).

# forsyde-vm
Repository hosting the build scripts and steps to produce ForSyDe VMs and containers.

Currently only the "Debian" port of the ForSyDe VM exists and is maintained.
